# 🌊 Waves Project

This project is a simple web-based visualization of **Waves**, created using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It is designed for **10th standard students** to easily understand the basic concepts of waves in physics.

I first visited the QuazarEdu platform
 and explored their Kinematics in 1D module to understand their approach. Based on that, I designed a simple, colorful, and responsive module that follows the same idea but focuses on waves.

## 📖 What Are Waves?
- Waves are **disturbances** that move through a medium or space.  
- They **carry energy** without the movement of matter.  

Examples in daily life:  
- 🌊 Water waves  
- 🔊 Sound waves  
- 💡 Light waves

## 📝 Types of Waves
1. **Mechanical Waves**
   - Need a medium (like air or water).  
   - Example: Sound waves.

2. **Electromagnetic Waves**
   - Do not need a medium.  
   - Example: Light waves.

3. **Transverse Waves**
   - Move **up and down** while the wave travels forward.  
   - Example: Water waves.

4. **Longitudinal Waves**
   - Move **back and forth** in the same direction as the wave.  
   - Example: Sound waves.
